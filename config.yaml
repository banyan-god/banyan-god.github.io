      ## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
      I'm Sabareesh Subramani, a tech enthusiast, seasoned CTO, and lifelong learner with a passion for building scalable systems and exploring the fascinating world of AI. Whether it's driving innovation in cloud technology or fine-tuning LLMs, I love solving problems and turning ideas into impactful solutions.

      ## What I Do ðŸš€
      - **Chief Technology Officer**: Crafting scalable architectures and leading tech teams to deliver high-availability systems.
      - **AI & ML Explorer**: Experimenting with LLMs, reinforcement learning, and distributed training on custom-built hardware.
      - **Cloud Wizard**: Mastering AWS, Azure, and Kubernetes to optimize performance and scalability.

      ## My Machine Learning Journey ðŸ§ 
      From tinkering with NanoGPTs to fine-tuning Llama2 models, Iâ€™ve immersed myself in ML, sharing insights along the way on [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).

      ## Fun Fact ðŸŽ‰
      Iâ€™ve built a workstation powered by an AMD Threadripper and 4 NVIDIA 4090 GPUs to push the boundaries of AI experimentation. Tech geek? Guilty as charged.

      Letâ€™s create something extraordinary together!
