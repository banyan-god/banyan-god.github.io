# Building a Rig to Train LLMs from Scratch

The journey into Large Language Models (LLMs) began with the electrifying moment ChatGPT made waves, sparking a realization of AI’s transformative potential. I initially dabbled with diffusion models, captivated by their ability to create stunning visuals, but the sluggish performance on an M1 chip made me crave more power. This fueled my ambition to build a custom rig with a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU. As I delved deeper into the world of LLMs, experimenting with multi-agent ecosystems, it became clear that mastering the fundamentals was paramount. Recognizing the need for multiple GPUs, I shifted focus to training LLMs from scratch, pushing beyond inference to truly understand the inner workings of these groundbreaking models.

Training Large Language Models (LLMs) from scratch requires a combination of powerful hardware, efficient software configuration, and a strategic approach to ensure success.


Here’s a comprehensive guide to building a custom rig tailored for LLM training.

---

## 1. Planning Your Build

- **Define Your Objectives**: Determine the scale and type of models you want to train. Smaller models may work with limited resources, but larger architectures demand higher computational power.

- **Budgeting**: Set a realistic budget to balance performance with cost. Note that high-end components, especially GPUs, can be costly.

---

## 2. Selecting Hardware Components

- **Motherboard**: Choose a board with sufficient PCIe lanes to support multiple GPUs. The SuperMicro M12SWA-TF is a popular choice for high-performance builds.

- **CPU**: Opt for a robust processor like the AMD Threadripper PRO 5955WX. The primary reason for choosing this CPU is its **128 PCIe lanes**, allowing you to connect multiple GPUs without bandwidth constraints.

- **Memory (RAM)**: At least 128 GB of RAM is recommended to manage large datasets and minimize bottlenecks.

- **GPUs**: NVIDIA 4090 GPUs are ideal for LLM training due to their advanced Ada architecture. Key benefits include:
  - **24 GB VRAM**: Sufficient for handling large models and datasets.
  - **Tensor Core Performance**: Fourth-generation tensor cores excel at bfloat16 precision, offering up to 660 TFLOPS of FP8 processing power.
  - **CUDA Cores**: 16,384 CUDA cores ensure unparalleled parallel processing capabilities.
  - **Architecture Advantages**: Enhanced ray tracing, Shader Execution Reordering, and DLSS 3 technology for improved efficiency.

  A setup with **2x NVIDIA 4090s** is a great starting point, with room to scale up to **4x NVIDIA 4090s** for advanced tasks.

- **Storage**: Invest in high-capacity SSDs for faster data access and efficient handling of large datasets.

- **Cooling System**: Effective cooling (air or liquid) is crucial to maintain hardware longevity during intensive workloads.

## 3. Assembling the Rig

- **Compatibility Check**: Ensure all components are compatible to avoid assembly issues.

- **Physical Assembly**: Carefully install components, paying special attention to GPU placement and spacing for optimal airflow.

- **Cable Management**: Organize cables neatly to improve airflow and simplify maintenance.

---

## 4. Software Configuration

- **Operating System**: Use a Linux-based OS (e.g., Ubuntu), known for its stability and suitability for machine learning tasks.

- **Drivers and Dependencies**: Install the latest GPU drivers, CUDA, and cuDNN libraries to maximize GPU performance.

- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: Set up frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow, essential for model training.

---

## 5. Training Large Language Models

- **Data Preparation**: Curate, clean, and preprocess datasets to ensure high-quality inputs for training.

- **Model Selection**: Choose architectures like Llama2 or GPT, tailored to your hardware and training goals.

- **Training Process**: Initiate training, monitor resource utilization, and adjust configurations as needed for optimal results.

---

## 6. Optimization and Scaling

- **Multi-GPU Training**: Use distributed training techniques such as Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) or ZeRO to fully utilize multiple GPUs.

- **George’s Hack**: Leverage the [kernel patch by George Hotz](https://github.com/tinygrad/open-gpu-kernel-modules) to enable peer-to-peer (P2P) communication for NVIDIA 4xxx GPUs, overcoming the lack of official support.

- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize hyperparameters, batch sizes, and learning rates to achieve better convergence and efficiency.

---

## 7. Maintenance and Monitoring

- **Regular Updates**: Keep your system and software updated to leverage the latest optimizations and security patches.

- **System Monitoring**: Use tools like NVIDIA’s nvidia-smi or Prometheus to track system health, utilization, and temperature.

---

## Key Insights and Tips

- **Hardware Alternatives**: While GPUs like the A100 or H100 provide higher VRAM, consumer GPUs such as the 4090 offer excellent performance for cost-conscious setups.

- **Cloud Considerations**: On-premise rigs are ideal for long-term projects and experimentation, but cloud solutions offer flexibility for short-term tasks.

- **Community Resources**: Explore tutorials from experts like [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) and guides from Hugging Face for additional insights.

Building a rig for LLM training is a challenging but rewarding endeavor that opens up opportunities to push the boundaries of AI development. With careful planning and execution, your custom setup can become a powerful tool for exploring the vast landscape of machine learning.
