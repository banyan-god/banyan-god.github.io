Hello here is my humble attempt to define what AGI is, may be we should version it AGI v1

### 1. The Capacity to Handle a Wide Range of Intellectual Tasks

Imagine being able to read a book, do some math, or solve a puzzle—all within the same system. AGI aims to achieve this level of versatility, unlike today's narrow AI systems that excel at specific tasks (like playing chess or recognizing faces). The goal of AGI is to create a single system capable of managing various tasks, much like how a person can adapt to different activities.

### 2. The Ability to Learn, Reason, and Generalize Across Diverse Tasks

Consider the possibility of addressing a new problem by applying knowledge gained from an entirely different area. While a chess engine is typically limited to chess, AGI aspires to transfer learning from one domain to another. For instance, insights from playing chess could potentially be used to analyze medical data or negotiate contracts. This flexibility would make AGI adaptable and capable of handling a wide array of situations.

### 3. Self-Improvement and Creative Problem-Solving

A notable aspect of human intelligence is our ability to adapt when facing new challenges—we experiment, learn from our experiences, and try different approaches. Similarly, AGI seeks to incorporate self-improvement mechanisms, enabling it to discover better ways to achieve its goals, develop creative solutions, and continually enhance its problem-solving strategies. This ongoing improvement process is a key feature that makes AGI both promising and intriguing.
